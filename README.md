# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Detection

#Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based approach for detecting tomato leaf diseases using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed system, called PCA DeepNet, combines the strengths of PCA and CNNs to classify tomato leaf images as healthy or diseased and detect various disease categories.

#Methodology
The PCA DeepNet system consists of the following steps:

#Data Preparation: The dataset is pre-processed and augmented to increase its size and diversity.
Feature Extraction: PCA is used to extract features from the pre-processed images.
Classification: A customized CNN classifier is used to classify the images as healthy or diseased.
Detection: A Faster Region-Based CNN (F-RCNN) is used to detect the disease categories.
Dataset
The dataset used in this study consists of [insert number] images of tomato leaves, divided into [insert number] classes. The dataset is balanced, with an equal number of healthy and diseased images.

#Performance Metrics
The performance of the PCA DeepNet system is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Results
The results of the PCA DeepNet system are presented in the form of tables and graphs, showing the performance of the system on the test dataset.

#Comparison with Other Works
The performance of the PCA DeepNet system is compared with other state-of-the-art methods on the Plant Village dataset.

#Conclusion
The PCA DeepNet system offers a promising approach for detecting tomato leaf diseases using deep learning and computer vision. The system's performance is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, making it a valuable tool for farmers and agricultural industries.

#Future Work
The PCA DeepNet system has the potential to be developed into a real-time system, providing instant detection of diseases and allowing for immediate response. Additionally, the system can be extended to detect diseases in other crops, making it a valuable tool for sustainable farming practices.
